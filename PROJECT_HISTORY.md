## Project Genesis

### Inception (August 2025)

**Vision Statement**:
> Create a professional, AI-powered wallpaper generation application that combines cutting-edge AI technology with exceptional user experience, making it easy for anyone to create stunning, device-optimized wallpapers.

**Initial Goals**:
1. Leverage Pollinations AI for high-quality image generation
2. Integrate Google Gemini for intelligent prompt enhancement
3. Build with modern web technologies (Angular 20, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
4. Ensure production-grade quality from day one
5. Provide comprehensive documentation for developers
6. Support offline functionality with Progressive Web App capabilities

**Motivation**:
- Fill the gap for a truly professional, open-source AI wallpaper tool
- Demonstrate best practices in modern Angular development
- Create a showcase for AI integration in web applications
- Build a foundation for future AI-powered creative tools

**Initial Technical Stack Selection**:
- **Framework**: Angular 20 (latest version with signals)
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.8 (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.0 (utility-first approach)
- **Storage**: IndexedDB (for local data persistence)
- **AI Services**: Pollinations AI + Google Gemini
- **PWA**: Angular Service Worker
- **Testing**: Jest + Playwright + Cypress
