## üÜò Rollback Procedure

If critical issues are discovered post-deployment:

1. **Assess Impact**

   - Identify affected users
   - Document the problem

2. **Execute Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Rollback to previous version
   # (Command depends on hosting provider)
   # Examples:
   # Netlify: netlify rollback
   # Vercel: vercel rollback
   # Git-based: git revert <commit> && git push
   # Manual: restore previous build artifacts
   ```

3. **Verify Rollback**
   - Test that previous version is working
   - Verify issue is resolved
   - Monitor for stability

4. **Post-Mortem**
   - Document what went wrong
