# Run all checks
npm run lint
npm test -- --coverage
npm run e2e:headless
npm audit
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Production Build
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build -- --configuration=production

# Verify build output
ls -lah dist/app/
```

### Step 3: Pre-Deploy Testing
```bash
# Test production build locally
npx serve dist/app --listen 8080

# Test in browser: http://localhost:8080
# Verify:
# - App loads correctly
# - No console errors
# - Functionality works
# - Service worker registers (if applicable)
```

### Step 4: Deploy to Staging
```bash
# Deploy to staging environment
# (Command depends on hosting provider)

# Examples:
# Netlify: netlify deploy --dir=dist/app --prod
# Vercel: vercel --prod
# Firebase: firebase deploy
# Custom: rsync -avz dist/app/ user@server:/var/www/html/
```

### Step 5: Staging Validation
- [ ] Test on staging URL
- [ ] Verify security headers (securityheaders.com)

## üÜò Rollback Procedure

If critical issues are discovered post-deployment:

1. **Assess Impact**
   - Determine severity of issue
   - Identify affected users
   - Document the problem

2. **Execute Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Rollback to previous version
   # (Command depends on hosting provider)
   # Examples:
   # Netlify: netlify rollback
   # Vercel: vercel rollback
   # Git-based: git revert <commit> && git push
   # Manual: restore previous build artifacts
   ```

3. **Verify Rollback**
   - Test that previous version is working
   - Verify issue is resolved
   - Monitor for stability

4. **Post-Mortem**
   - Document what went wrong
   - Identify root cause
   - Plan corrective actions
   - Update procedures to prevent recurrence
