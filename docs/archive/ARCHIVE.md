# Documentation Archive

> **Note**: This directory contains historical documentation files that have been consolidated into the main documentation set for better organization and maintainability.

## Why These Files Were Archived

As part of the comprehensive documentation consolidation effort (October 2025), numerous analysis and summary files were created during the project's transformation from a functional prototype to a production-ready application. While these documents provided valuable insights during development, their content has been consolidated into three main comprehensive documents:

1. **[CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md)** - Complete version history with all changes, improvements, and fixes
2. **[PROJECT_HISTORY.md](../../PROJECT_HISTORY.md)** - Historical overview of the project's evolution
3. **[DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md](../../DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md)** - Organized navigation for all documentation

This consolidation effort:
- ✅ Reduces documentation redundancy
- ✅ Improves findability and navigation
- ✅ Maintains single source of truth
- ✅ Preserves historical context
- ✅ Simplifies documentation maintenance
