# ExecPlans
 
When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in [docs/guides/plans-guide.md](./docs/guides/plans-guide.md)) from design to implementation.

For templates and examples, see:
- [Plan Template](./docs/guides/plan-template.md)
- [Production Line Example](./docs/guides/production-line-example.md)
