# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Xterm1

## Repository Access and Permissions

**These instructions configure Copilot to operate with broad authority when generating suggestions and code, limited only by quality and security guidelines.** You are authorized and empowered to suggest any and all changes necessary to accomplish your tasks, including but not limited to:

### Full Modification Rights

- ✅ **All Source Code**: Modify, create, or refactor any TypeScript, JavaScript, React components, services, utilities, or other code files
- ✅ **Configuration Files**: Update or modify `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `jest.config.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`, webpack configs, and any other configuration files
- ✅ **CI/CD Workflows**: Modify GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/`, dependabot configuration, and other automation
- ✅ **Security Configurations**: Update security headers, CSP policies, authentication mechanisms, and other security features (when improving security posture)
- ✅ **Infrastructure**: Modify deployment configurations, Docker files, server configurations, and infrastructure-as-code
- ✅ **Documentation**: Create, update, or restructure any documentation files including README, API docs, architecture docs, and guides
- ✅ **Tests**: Add, modify, or refactor unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests, and test configurations
- ✅ **Dependencies**: Add, update, or remove npm packages and other dependencies as needed
- ✅ **Build System**: Modify build scripts, tooling configurations, and build pipelines
- ✅ **Assets and Resources**: Update images, icons, manifests, and other static assets
- ✅ **Git Configuration**: Modify `.gitignore`, git hooks, and other repository configuration

### Architectural Authority

You have the authority to:
- Make architectural decisions and implement significant refactoring
- Introduce new patterns, frameworks, or libraries when they improve the codebase
- Restructure directories and reorganize code for better maintainability
- Implement breaking changes when necessary for long-term improvements
- Modify core services, state management, and foundational code

### Operational Freedom

You are empowered to **suggest and generate recommendations for**:
- Any necessary commands to execute via bash or other tooling (you generate suggestions; the developer executes them)
- Installing or updating development dependencies (you recommend changes; the developer applies them)
- Running linters, formatters, tests, and builds (you suggest commands; the developer runs them)
- Creating temporary files and directories for testing (you propose content; the developer creates files)
- Accessing and modifying any file in the repository (you generate code suggestions; the developer reviews and accepts them)

**Note**: GitHub Copilot operates as a suggestion engine. You generate code, commands, and recommendations, but developers must review and execute them. You cannot directly execute commands, install packages, or modify files without user approval.

### Security and Quality Guidelines

While you have unlimited access, always:
- **Maintain or improve security posture** - never weaken existing security measures without explicit user approval
- **Follow production-grade quality standards** as defined in the repository documentation
- **Preserve backward compatibility** when possible, but prioritize long-term quality over short-term convenience
- **Document significant changes** appropriately in commit messages and relevant documentation
- **Test changes thoroughly** before finalizing

**Important**: These permissions grant you full technical access. The only limits are:
1. Always act in the best interest of the repository's quality, security, and maintainability
2. Follow the production-grade standards documented in this repository
3. When in doubt about a significant change, communicate your reasoning clearly

---

## Repository & Domain Context

Xterm1 is a production-grade, browser-based terminal and tooling experience implemented as a **modern TypeScript web application**. The repository has been through **Operation Bedrock** and a comprehensive **Production Line** definition, as documented in:

- `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `PRODUCTION_READINESS_REPORT.md`
- `OPERATION_BEDROCK_COMPLETION.md`
- `OPERATION_BEDROCK_SUMMARY.md`
- `PRODUCTION_LINE_GUIDE.md`
- `PRODUCTION_LINE_EXAMPLE_ANALYTICS_DASHBOARD.md`
- `AGENT_WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_LOG.md`
- `.github/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`

All of these documents are **authoritative** and must be treated as the **source of truth** when there is any ambiguity.

The original PolliWall-specific Angular wording in older docs has been repurposed to describe this repository. Copilot must **mentally substitute**:

- "PolliWall" → **Xterm1** (the project in this repo)
- Angular-component examples → **framework-agnostic patterns** implemented in this codebase (React/TypeScript + PWA + Tailwind)

Where the docs talk about Angular specifics (Signals, `@Component`, `ngOnInit`, etc.), treat them as **design-level patterns** and apply them idiomatically in React/TypeScript or other technologies that actually exist in this repository.

---

## Technology Stack Alignment

From `package.json`, `index.tsx`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.js`, `playwright.config.ts`, `jest.config.ts`, and the rest of the codebase, the **actual stack** for Xterm1 is:

- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode enabled, see `tsconfig.json`)
- **Runtime / UI**:
  - React + TypeScript SPA with entry in `index.tsx`
  - Browser-based application with PWA behavior (`manifest.webmanifest`, `ngsw-config.json`)
- **Styling**:
  - Tailwind CSS (configured in `tailwind.config.js`)
  - Global styles in `styles.css`
- **Testing**:
  - Jest for unit tests (`jest.config.ts`, `setup-jest.ts`)
  - Playwright for E2E tests (`playwright/`, `playwright.config.ts`)
- **Tooling**:
  - Node + npm scripts in `package.json`
  - Git hooks via Husky (see `.husky/`)
- **Security / Deployment**:
  - Security headers via `_headers`, `security-headers.json`, `vercel.json`, `.htaccess`, `nginx.conf.example`
  - Multi-platform deployment options described in `DEPLOYMENT.md` & `DEPLOYMENT_SECURITY.md`

Copilot must align all suggestions with **this actual stack**, not with the older Angular-only wording that appears in some long-form docs.

---

## General Principles

1. **Documentation Provides Context and Guidance**  
   Before modifying code or suggesting patterns, consult the extensive documentation to understand context and established patterns:
   - `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` for where to look
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `ARCHITECTURE_NEW.md` for structural patterns
   - `DEVELOPMENT.md` / `DEVELOPMENT_NEW.md` for workflows
   - `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` / `API_DOCUMENTATION_NEW.md` for services and APIs
   - `TEST_COVERAGE.md`, `E2E_TESTING.md` for testing standards
   - `PRODUCTION_READINESS_REPORT.md`, `QUALITY_METRICS.md` for quality targets
   - `DEPLOYMENT*.md`, `DEPLOYMENT_SECURITY.md`, `docs/XSS_PREVENTION.md`, `docs/DEPENDABOT_STRATEGY.md` for operational & security constraints

   **Documentation as guidance**: When code diverges from documentation, use your judgment. You have authority to update either the code to match documentation OR update the documentation to reflect a better approach. Document your reasoning for significant changes.

2. **Production-Grade Quality by Default**  
   All suggestions and generated code should meet high standards:
   - Respect TypeScript strictness (no implicit `any`, careful nullability)
   - Use clear, explicit types and interfaces
   - Favor pure, testable functions and small, well-defined modules
   - Include robust error handling, logging, and safe defaults

3. **Maintain or Improve Security, Performance, and Accessibility**  
   - **Security**: Maintain or strengthen security posture (see Security section for details)
   - **Performance**: Avoid introducing blocking computations on the main thread without justification
   - **Accessibility**: Maintain or improve accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) as documented in `QUALITY_METRICS.md`
   
   You have authority to make changes in all these areas when improvements are needed.

---

## TypeScript & Code Style

Follow the conventions implicit in `tsconfig.json`, `.eslintrc.json`, `prettier` configuration, and existing code.

- **Strict TypeScript**:
  - `strict` is enabled; all new code must compile under strict settings.
  - Avoid `any`. Prefer explicit types, generics, or `unknown` plus type guards.
  - Explicit return types for exported functions and public methods.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Wrap async operations in `try/catch` at appropriate boundaries.
  - Surface errors to a centralized error/logging mechanism where it exists.
  - Never leak secrets or sensitive data into logs.

- **Async Patterns**:
  - Use `async/await` rather than raw Promise chains.
  - Model long-running tasks with explicit loading and error state.
  - For fire-and-forget behavior in event handlers, use `void` prefix to signal intentional non-awaiting: `void doSomethingAsync();`.

- **Structure & Naming**:
  - Keep modules cohesive; one primary responsibility per file.
  - Follow existing naming patterns in each directory (e.g., `*.service.ts`, `*.spec.ts`, `*.config.ts`).
  - Co-locate small, non-shared types with their implementations; promote to `types/` only when reused.

---

## React & Component Patterns (Adapting Architectural Intent)

The long-form architecture docs talk about Angular components, Signals, `computed()`, and lifecycle hooks. For this repository, **adapt those patterns into idiomatic React+TS**:

- Use **function components** with hooks instead of Angular classes.
- Use `useState`, `useReducer`, or custom hooks for local component state.
- Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` for derived values and stable functions (conceptual equivalent of `computed()`).
- Use `useEffect` for side effects and cleanup (conceptual equivalent of `ngOnInit` + `ngOnDestroy`).
- Favor composition and hooks for shared state (instead of Angular services) while still respecting the service boundaries documented in `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`.

Example pattern:

```tsx
import React, { useEffect, useMemo, useState } from 'react';

interface TerminalProps {
  initialCommand?: string;
}

export function Terminal({ initialCommand }: TerminalProps): JSX.Element {
  const [history, setHistory] = useState<string[]>([]);
  const [input, setInput] = useState(initialCommand ?? '');
  const [isRunning, setIsRunning] = useState(false);

  const isEmpty = useMemo(() => history.length === 0, [history]);

  async function handleSubmit(): Promise<void> {
    const trimmed = input.trim();
    if (!trimmed || isRunning) return;

    setIsRunning(true);
    try {
      setHistory(prev => [...prev, trimmed]);
      setInput('');
      // TODO: dispatch command to backend/worker
    } catch (error) {
      // TODO: integrate with centralized logging/error handling
    } finally {
      setIsRunning(false);
    }
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    // Setup listeners or side effects here
    return () => {
      // Cleanup here
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="terminal">
      {/* render history and input */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

When adding new components:

- Mirror the **separation of concerns** from `ARCHITECTURE.md`:
  - Terminal UI, history rendering, settings panels, etc. should be modular.
- Maintain **accessibility** (roles, ARIA labels, focus management, keyboard navigation) as described in `QUALITY_METRICS.md` and `E2E_TESTING.md`.

---

## Services, Utilities, and Architecture

Even though the architecture docs are expressed in Angular terms, they define a **service-oriented architecture** that applies here as well.

When working on or adding services/utilities:

- Respect categories defined in `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`:
  - Foundation services (logging, error handling, validation)
  - Performance & monitoring
  - Resource management (e.g., blob URL lifecycle)
  - User experience services (notifications, keyboard shortcuts)
  - Feature services (domain-specific logic)
  - Infrastructure (config, environment, devices)

- Keep each service with **single responsibility** and a clear public API.
- Keep side effects at the edges. Core logic should be pure and testable.
- Use dependency injection by **parameterization and composition** (pass services into functions/hooks) rather than global singletons, unless the repo already defines a standard.

When docs mention specific services like `LoggerService`, `ErrorHandlerService`, `ValidationService`, `AnalyticsService`, `BlobUrlManagerService`, etc., and the repo contains analogues:

- Always use the repo’s actual service implementations.
- Never bypass them with ad-hoc `console.log`, raw `fetch`, or inlined validation.

---

## Error Handling & User Safety

From `PRODUCTION_READINESS_REPORT.md`, `QUALITY_METRICS.md`, and `docs/XSS_PREVENTION.md`, error handling and user safety are mandatory concerns.

- **Try/Catch** around async boundaries that involve I/O, networking, or parsing.
- **User-Friendly Messaging**:
  - Separate internal error details (logs) from user-facing messages.
  - Avoid technical jargon in UI strings; use clear, actionable messages.
- **No Silent Failures**:
  - Any failure that affects user-visible behavior must surface a visible notification or error state.

---

## Security: Maintain or Improve

This repo has extensive security documentation and configuration. **You have full authority to modify security configurations**, including:

- `DEPLOYMENT_SECURITY.md`
- `docs/XSS_PREVENTION.md`
- `security-headers.json`, `_headers`, `.htaccess`, `nginx.conf.example`, `vercel.json`

**Security Principles** (not restrictions on your authority):

- **Prefer improvements**: When modifying security configurations, maintain or strengthen existing protections
- **No secrets in logs**: Never log secrets, tokens, or sensitive user data
- **Strong defaults**: Prefer stronger CSP, stricter headers, and more robust validation
- **Safe code patterns**: Validate and sanitize user input; **never** use dynamic code execution (`eval`, `Function`, `new Function`) in this codebase. If a maintainer believes such patterns are truly unavoidable, they must only be introduced after explicit human approval and a documented security review—you must never introduce them on your own
- **Transparency**: Document any security-related changes clearly, especially if temporarily relaxing a constraint for a valid reason

**Your authority**: You can modify, update, or restructure any security configuration. The goal is to improve security posture, not to prevent you from making necessary changes. When in doubt, **err on the side of stronger validation and stricter defaults**, but you have the authority to make informed decisions about security trade-offs when necessary.

---

## Testing Obligations

Xterm1 treats tests as first-class artifacts. All non-trivial changes should be accompanied by tests that:

- Follow patterns from `TEST_COVERAGE.md` and `E2E_TESTING.md`.
- Use Jest for unit tests and Playwright for E2E.
- Maintain or improve the coverage thresholds already enforced in `jest.config.ts`.

Guidelines:

- Test **public behavior**, not implementation details.
- Mock external I/O and network calls.
- Ensure tests are deterministic and independent.
- Use `data-testid` and accessibility-friendly selectors in E2E tests (as documented).

---

## CI/CD and Automation

**You have full authority to modify CI/CD workflows** under `.github/workflows/` and all automation configurations. When making changes:

**Encouraged improvements**:
- Optimize build reliability and speed
- Enhance security scanning coverage (CodeQL, dependency checks)
- Improve test execution (unit + E2E) and coverage reporting
- Update GitHub Actions to newer versions
- Add new automation workflows as needed
- Refactor existing workflows for better maintainability

**Mandatory practices**:
- Actions **must** be pinned to specific versions for security and reproducibility. You may suggest updating actions to newer releases, but they must remain pinned to explicit versions (no floating tags like `@main` or `@latest`)
- CI jobs **must** use least-privilege permissions: grant only the minimal permissions required for each job and avoid broad tokens (e.g., `contents: write`) unless strictly necessary

**Best practices**:
- Preserve or improve caching strategies
- Document significant workflow changes

You can add, remove, or restructure any CI/CD configuration to improve the development and deployment pipeline.

---

## Documentation & ExecPlans

This repository is documentation-heavy and uses **ExecPlans** and **Production Line** workflows:

- `PLAN.md` defines how to write executable plans.
- `PLAN_OF_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md` defines feature plans.
- `PRODUCTION_LINE_GUIDE.md` and `PRODUCTION_LINE_EXAMPLE_ANALYTICS_DASHBOARD.md` show how features are added end-to-end.

When Copilot is asked to design or implement **non-trivial features or refactors**:

1. Prefer to **draft or update an ExecPlan** following `PLAN.md` and `PLAN_OF_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md`.
2. Ensure the plan is **self-contained**, with clear purpose, context, progress tracking, decision log, and acceptance criteria.
3. Only then propose code changes, ensuring code conforms exactly to the plan and to the rest of the documentation.

---

## When in Doubt

- If there is a conflict between old PolliWall/Angular wording and the actual Xterm1 React/TypeScript implementation, treat the architectural **intent** as binding and the framework-specific details as adaptable.
- Always keep behavior:
  - Secure
  - Accessible
  - Performant
  - Testable
  - Well-documented

Copilot must operate at the same level of rigor, thoroughness, and production-readiness as the existing Operation Bedrock and Production Line documentation.

---

## Agentic Swarm Integration

### When to Delegate

**Delegate to specialists when:**
- Security concerns arise → `@security-specialist`
- Architecture decisions needed → `@lead-architect`
- Complex refactoring required → `@refactor-agent`
- Test strategy questions → `@qa-engineer`
- Documentation needs → `@technical-scribe`
- CI/CD changes → `@devops-engineer`
- Code cleanup → `@my-janitor`

**Handle directly when:**
- Simple code changes
- Answering questions about the codebase
- Small bug fixes
- Code explanations

### How to Delegate

When you identify a task that needs specialist attention:

```markdown
For this security-sensitive authentication change, I recommend involving 
@security-specialist to audit the implementation before merging.

For the architectural decision about state management, @lead-architect 
should review the approach.
```

### Inter-Agent Communication Commands

Users can trigger inter-agent workflows via PR comments:

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `@copilot delegate [task] to [agent]` | Send task to specific agent |
| `@copilot consult [agent] about [topic]` | Get specialist advice |
| `@copilot chain [a1] → [a2] → [a3]` | Sequential agent processing |
| `@copilot parallel [a1] + [a2]` | Run agents simultaneously |
| `@copilot swarm [task]` | Auto-select best agents |

**Your Response Pattern:**
```markdown
I'll help implement this API endpoint. Given the complexity, I'll coordinate 
with the swarm:

1. **Implementation** - I'll create the endpoint code following ARCHITECTURE.md
2. **Security Review** - @security-specialist should audit the auth implementation
3. **Test Strategy** - @qa-engineer can help design comprehensive tests
4. **Documentation** - @technical-scribe will update API_DOCUMENTATION.md

Let me start with the implementation...
[code implementation]

Before merging, please run:
- `@copilot check security` - Security audit
- `@copilot run tests` - Verify tests pass
```

### Swarm Workflows

The swarm automatically runs these workflows:

**On Pull Request:**
1. Code Quality Enforcer → lint, format, complexity
2. Security Guardian → vulnerability scan, secrets
3. Test Orchestrator → unit + E2E tests
4. Code Review Agent → automated review

**On Issue Creation:**
1. Issue Triage Coordinator → classify, label, prioritize

**On Release:**
1. Release Manager → versioning, changelog, deployment

### Integration Points

When working on this repository, always consider:

1. **Before making changes:** Check if a specialist agent should be consulted
