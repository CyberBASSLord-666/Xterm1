## What is the Agentic Swarm?

The Agentic Swarm is a collection of **26 specialized automation agents** that work together to manage every aspect of this Angular 20 + TypeScript repository's lifecycle. Think of it as having a team of expert robots that:

- ✅ Automatically review your code
- ✅ Run tests and check coverage
- ✅ Scan for security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Monitor performance
- ✅ Manage dependencies
- ✅ Create releases
- ✅ Triage issues
- ✅ Generate documentation
- ✅ **Refactor code and apply suggestions**
- ✅ **Delegate tasks to each other automatically**
- ✅ **AUTONOMOUS MODE: Self-fix detected issues without human intervention**

**The swarm runs automatically** - you don't need to configure anything to get started!

### Key Feature: Inter-Agent Communication

Agents in this swarm can **call upon each other** for specialized tasks. This means:
- The code review agent can ask the security agent to audit suspicious code
- The refactor agent can consult the architect agent for design decisions
- Any agent can delegate documentation updates to the technical writer

This creates a truly collaborative swarm where agents work together intelligently.

---

## Autonomous Mode (NEW)

### What is Autonomous Mode?

The Agentic Swarm now operates in **fully autonomous mode**, meaning it can:

1. **Detect issues** - Lint errors, security vulnerabilities, test failures
2. **Automatically trigger fixes** - Comments `@copilot fix all` (or specific commands) on the PR
3. **Apply fixes** - The fix workflow runs and commits changes
4. **Escalate when needed** - If fixes can't be applied, it comments with specific guidance for manual intervention

### How It Works

```
You open/update a PR
        │
        ├→ [Swarm Coordinator] analyzes the PR
        │
        ├→ [Stage 1: Detect Issues]
        │   ├─ Lint check runs
        │   ├─ Security scan runs
        │   └─ Tests run
        │
        ├→ [Stage 2: Evaluate Results]
        │   ├─ Issues detected?
        │   │   ├─ YES → Continue to Stage 3
        │   │   └─ NO → ✅ All checks passed!
        │   │
        │   └─ Auto-fix already attempted?
        │       ├─ YES → Skip (prevent infinite loops)
        │       └─ NO → Continue to Stage 3
        │
        ├→ [Stage 3: Autonomous Fix Trigger]
        │   ├─ Multiple issues? → Comment: `@copilot fix all`
        │   ├─ Lint only? → Comment: `@copilot fix lint`
        │   └─ Security only? → Comment: `@copilot fix security`
        │
        ├→ [Stage 4: Fix Workflow Runs]
        │   ├─ ESLint with --fix
        │   ├─ Prettier formatting
        │   ├─ npm audit fix
        │   └─ Commit & push fixes
        │
        └→ [Stage 5: Escalation (if needed)]
            ├─ Issues remain after fix?
            │   ├─ YES → Post escalation comment with guidance
            │   └─ NO → ✅ All issues fixed!
            │
            └─ Add labels for tracking
```

### Labels Used by Autonomous Mode

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `swarm-auto-fix-attempted` | Swarm has attempted autonomous fixes on this PR |
| `swarm-auto-fix-in-progress` | Swarm autonomous fix is currently running |
| `swarm-auto-fix-complete` | Swarm autonomous fix process has completed |
| `needs-manual-fix` | Issues remain that require manual intervention |

### Preventing Infinite Loops

The swarm uses multiple safeguards to prevent infinite fix loops:

1. **Commit detection** - If the last commit was made by `github-actions[bot]` with a "🤖" or "Auto-fix" message, autonomous triggers are skipped
2. **Label tracking** - Once `swarm-auto-fix-attempted` is added, no further autonomous triggers occur
3. **Bot actor check** - Won't run on dependabot PRs

### What Gets Fixed Automatically

| Issue Type | Auto-Fixable? | How |
|------------|---------------|-----|
| ESLint errors | ✅ Many | `eslint --fix` |
| Prettier formatting | ✅ All | `prettier --write` |
| npm vulnerabilities | ✅ Some | `npm audit fix` |
| Type errors | ❌ No | Manual intervention |
| Test failures | ❌ No | Manual intervention |
| Complex refactoring | ❌ No | Manual intervention |

### Escalation Messages

When issues can't be auto-fixed, you'll receive a detailed escalation comment:

```markdown
## 🚨 Manual Intervention Required

The Agentic Swarm has completed its automated fixes, but some issues remain...

### Remaining Issues

#### 📝 ESLint Issues (3 errors, 5 warnings)
**Suggested Actions:**
1. Run `npm run lint` locally to see detailed error messages
2. Common unfixable issues include:
   - Type errors that require code restructuring
   - Import/export issues
   - Complex refactoring requirements
...

#### 🔒 Security Vulnerabilities (2 remaining)
**Suggested Actions:**
1. Run `npm audit` locally to see detailed vulnerability information
2. Try `npm audit fix --force` (may introduce breaking changes)
...
```

### Disabling Autonomous Mode

To disable autonomous fixes for a specific PR, add this label before the first push:

```
swarm-auto-fix-attempted
```

This tells the swarm that an auto-fix was already attempted, preventing any autonomous triggers.

## For Developers

### When You Open a Pull Request

**What happens automatically:**

1. **Within 1 minute:**
   - Code quality checks (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
   - Security scanning (secrets, vulnerabilities)
   - Documentation validation

2. **Within 5 minutes:**
   - All unit tests run
   - Code coverage calculated
   - Accessibility tests

3. **Within 15 minutes:**
   - End-to-end tests (Playwright)
   - Performance analysis (bundle size, Lighthouse)
   - Automated code review comments

4. **Within 20 minutes:**
   - Final approval or change requests
   - Summary report with all findings

**What you'll see:**

```
✓ Code Quality Check passed
✓ Security Scan passed
✓ Tests (Jest) passed - Coverage: 85%
✓ Accessibility Check passed
✓ Performance Check passed
⚠ Code Review found 2 suggestions
```

### Understanding Check Results

#### ✅ Green Check (Passed)
Your code meets all requirements. No action needed.

#### ⚠️ Yellow Warning
Non-blocking suggestions for improvement. PR can be merged, but consider addressing.

**Example:**
```
⚠ Bundle size increased by 3%
Consider code-splitting or lazy loading
```

#### ❌ Red X (Failed - Blocks Merge)
Critical issues that must be fixed before merging.

**Common failures:**
- ESLint errors
- Test failures
- Security vulnerabilities (critical/high)
- Coverage decrease
- WCAG violations

### How to Fix Issues

1. **Read the agent's comment** - It will tell you exactly what's wrong
2. **Fix the code** - Address the specific issues
3. **Push changes** - The agents re-run automatically
4. **Wait for re-check** - Usually completes in 5-10 minutes

**Example workflow:**

```bash
# Agent reports: "ESLint error: 'foo' is not defined"

# Fix the code
vim src/components/MyComponent.ts

# Push changes
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve ESLint error"
git push

# Agents automatically re-run checks
```

### Using GitHub Copilot Agents

The 8 markdown agents work as **GitHub Copilot custom agents**. Use them directly in your IDE:

```
@code-assistant How do I implement a new feature?
@lead-architect Is this architecture pattern correct?
@qa-engineer What tests should I write?
@security-specialist Is this code secure?
@refactor-agent Please refactor this function to use async/await
```

### Using Swarm Commands in Comments

You can interact with the Agentic Swarm directly through PR comments using these commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `@copilot help` | Show all available commands |
| `@copilot fix lint` | Auto-fix ESLint and Prettier issues, commit the changes |
| `@copilot run tests` | Run the test suite and report results |
| `@copilot check security` | Run npm audit and report vulnerabilities |
| `@copilot apply suggestions` | List pending review suggestions to apply |
| `@copilot summarize` | Generate a summary of PR changes by category |
| `@copilot status` | Show status of all CI/CD checks |

**Example: Auto-fixing lint issues**

Just comment on your PR:
```
@copilot fix lint
```

The swarm will:
1. Run ESLint with `--fix` flag
2. Run Prettier to format code
3. Commit and push the changes automatically
4. Reply with a summary of what was fixed

**Example: Running security scan**

```
@copilot check security
```

You'll get a table showing vulnerabilities by severity and recommended actions.

### Refactoring Commands

The swarm can perform comprehensive code refactoring via PR comments:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `@copilot refactor` | General code refactoring (lint, format, cleanup) |
| `@copilot modernize` | Update deprecated patterns to modern standards |
| `@copilot optimize` | Performance optimization and improvements |
| `@copilot simplify` | Reduce code complexity |
| `@copilot apply suggestions` | Apply pending review suggestions from code review |
| `@copilot extract [type] [name] from [file]` | Extract code to separate module |

**Example: Applying all review suggestions**

When reviewers leave suggestions using GitHub's suggestion blocks, you can apply them all at once:

```
@copilot apply suggestions
```

The swarm will:
1. Find all pending `suggestion` blocks in review comments
2. Apply each suggestion to the appropriate file
3. Run lint and format on the changed files
4. Commit and push the changes
5. Report a summary of applied suggestions

**Example: Modernizing code**

```
@copilot modernize src/services/
```

The swarm will:
1. Analyze the target files for deprecated patterns
2. Apply ESLint fixes for outdated syntax
3. Update import patterns
4. Commit with a clear description of changes

**Example: Extracting a function to a module**

```
@copilot extract function validateEmail from src/utils/validators.ts
```

The swarm will:
1. Find the `validateEmail` function in the source file
2. Create a new file `src/utils/validateemail.function.ts`
3. Move the function with proper exports
4. Update the original file with an import statement
5. Commit the extraction

**Using the Refactor Agent in Copilot Chat**

For more complex refactoring operations, use the `@refactor-agent` directly:

```
@refactor-agent Please convert all callbacks in this file to async/await
@refactor-agent Simplify the UserService class
@refactor-agent Apply the review feedback about splitting the validation logic
```

The refactor agent can:
- Analyze natural language requests
- Understand code review feedback
- Perform structural refactoring
- Modernize TypeScript patterns
- Apply design patterns

---

## Inter-Agent Communication

The swarm supports sophisticated inter-agent communication, allowing agents to delegate tasks to each other.

### Inter-Agent Commands

Use these commands in PR comments to orchestrate multiple agents:

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `@copilot delegate [task] to [agent]` | Send a task to a specific agent | `@copilot delegate security review to security-specialist` |
| `@copilot consult [agent] about [topic]` | Get advice from a specialist | `@copilot consult lead-architect about this design` |
| `@copilot chain [a1] → [a2] → [a3]` | Sequential agent processing | `@copilot chain code-quality → tests → docs` |
| `@copilot parallel [a1] + [a2]` | Run agents simultaneously | `@copilot parallel security + performance + accessibility` |
| `@copilot swarm [task]` | Let coordinator pick best agents | `@copilot swarm comprehensive code review` |

### Agent Shortnames

Use these shortnames in inter-agent commands:

| Shortname | Agent | Capabilities |
|-----------|-------|--------------|
| `code-quality` | Code Quality Enforcer | Lint, format, complexity analysis |
| `security` | Security Guardian | Vulnerability scan, secret detection |
| `tests` | Test Orchestrator | Unit tests, E2E, coverage |
| `performance` | Performance Engineer | Bundle analysis, Lighthouse |
| `accessibility` | Accessibility Validator | WCAG compliance |
| `docs` | Documentation Curator | Changelog, API docs |
| `refactor` | Refactor Agent | Code modernization, suggestions |
| `review` | Code Review Agent | Automated PR review |
| `lead-architect` | Lead Architect | Architecture decisions |
| `security-specialist` | Security Specialist | Security audits |
| `qa` | QA Engineer | Test strategy |
| `janitor` | My Janitor | Code cleanup |

### Example: Comprehensive PR Validation

```
@copilot parallel security + performance + accessibility
```

This runs security scan, performance analysis, and accessibility validation **simultaneously**, returning results from all three agents.

### Example: Sequential Processing Chain

```
@copilot chain code-quality → tests → docs
```

This:
1. First runs code quality checks (lint, format)
2. Then runs the test suite
3. Finally updates documentation

Each step passes its context to the next.

### Example: Smart Agent Selection

```
@copilot swarm review this PR for production readiness
```

The Swarm Coordinator analyzes your request and automatically selects the best combination of agents:
- Security Guardian for vulnerability scan
- Performance Engineer for bundle analysis
- Code Review Agent for quality assessment
- Accessibility Validator for WCAG compliance

### How Agents Collaborate

When you invoke an agent, it can automatically delegate to other agents:

```
User: @code-assistant implement authentication

Code Assistant:
1. Implements the authentication feature
2. Delegates security review to @security-specialist
3. Delegates test generation to @qa-engineer
4. Delegates documentation to @technical-scribe
5. Coordinates all results into a complete solution
```

### Agent Registry

The complete agent registry with all capabilities is defined in:
- `.github/agents/inter-agent-protocol.json` - Protocol specification
- `.github/agents/swarm-manifest.json` - Agent inventory

---

## For Maintainers

### Managing Issues

Issues are **automatically triaged** by the `issue_triage_coordinator` agent:

**What happens when an issue is opened:**

1. **Classification** (within 5 minutes):
   - Type detected: bug, feature, security, documentation
   - Priority assigned: critical, high, medium, low
   - Labels applied automatically

2. **Assignment** (if applicable):
   - Security issues → security-specialist
   - Performance issues → performance-engineer
   - Documentation → technical-scribe

3. **Duplicate detection**:
   - Automatically links to existing issues
   - Comments with reference

**SLA Tracking:**

| Priority | Response Time | Resolution Time |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Critical | 4 hours | 1 day |
| High | 24 hours | 7 days |
| Medium | 3 days | 30 days |
| Low | 7 days | 90 days |

**What you need to do:**
- Review auto-assigned labels and adjust if needed
- Respond to critical issues within SLA
- Close stale issues when prompted

### Creating Releases

Use the `release_orchestration_manager` to automate releases:

**Option 1: Automatic Release (Recommended)**

```bash
# Trigger release workflow
gh workflow run release.yml
```

The agent will:
1. Calculate version (semantic versioning from commits)
2. Generate changelog
3. Create release notes
4. Build artifacts
5. Deploy to production
6. Create GitHub release

**Option 2: Manual Release**

```bash
# Create and push a tag
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3
```

The agent detects the tag and handles the rest.

**Release Notes are Automatic:**

Based on commit messages:
- `feat:` → "Added" section
- `fix:` → "Fixed" section
- `perf:` → "Performance" section
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` → "Breaking Changes" section (major version bump)

### Monitoring Production

The `monitoring_observability_specialist` runs continuously:

**What's monitored:**
- ✅ Uptime (5-minute checks)
- ✅ Error rates (real-time)
- ✅ Performance (Core Web Vitals)
- ✅ API health (external services)

**You'll be notified for:**
- SEV1: Production outage (immediate)
- SEV2: Major functionality impaired (1 hour)
- SEV3: Minor issues (4 hours)

**Check the dashboard:**
```
# View monitoring dashboard
Open: GitHub Actions → Monitoring Dashboard
```

## For Operations

### Scheduled Agent Runs

Agents run on these schedules:

| Frequency | Agents | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Every 5 minutes** | monitoring-observability-specialist | Uptime checks |
| **Every 30 minutes** | api-integration-validator | API health |
| **Every 4 hours** | issue-triage-coordinator | Issue updates |
| **Every 6 hours** | test-automation-orchestrator | Full test suite |
| **Every 12 hours** | performance-optimization-engineer | Performance scan |
| **Daily** | analytics-insights-agent | Business metrics |
| **Weekly** | dependency-lifecycle-manager | Dependency updates |
| **Weekly** | accessibility-compliance-validator | WCAG audit |
| **Monthly** | compliance-audit-specialist | License audit |

### Manual Agent Triggers

Trigger any agent manually via GitHub Actions:

```bash
# Navigate to Actions tab
GitHub → Actions → Select workflow → Run workflow

# Or via CLI
gh workflow run <workflow-name>.yml
```

**Common manual triggers:**

```bash
# Full security audit
gh workflow run security-audit.yml

# Performance analysis
gh workflow run performance-check.yml

# Dependency update
gh workflow run dependency-update.yml

# Compliance audit
gh workflow run compliance-audit.yml
```

### Viewing Agent Logs

**For a specific PR:**
1. Go to the PR
2. Click "Checks" tab
3. Select the agent workflow
4. View logs

**For scheduled runs:**
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select workflow
3. Click on recent run
4. View job logs

### Configuring Agent Behavior

Each agent has a configuration section in its JSON file:

**Example: Adjust code quality thresholds**

```json
// .github/agents/agent_code_quality_enforcer.json
{
  "configuration": {
    "quality_gates": {
      "max_cyclomatic_complexity": 10,  // Change this
      "min_test_coverage_line": 80       // Or this
    }
  }
}
```

**After changing configuration:**
- Commit the changes
- Agents pick up new config on next run
- No restart needed

            └─ Issues → ❌ Request Changes (with comments)
```

### Conflict Resolution

When agents disagree, the `swarm-orchestration-coordinator` resolves conflicts:

**Priority rules:**
1. Security always wins (security-guardian)
2. Tests must pass (test-automation-orchestrator)
3. Quality gates enforced (code-quality-enforcer)

**Example conflict:**
- Performance agent: "Bundle too large"
- Code quality agent: "All checks pass"
- **Resolution**: Warning issued, PR can merge (performance doesn't block)

---

## Customizing Agent Behavior

### Adjusting Quality Gates

**To change when PRs are blocked:**

Edit the agent's JSON configuration:

```json
// Example: Make coverage requirements stricter
{
  "configuration": {
    "quality_gates": {
      "min_test_coverage_line": 90,  // Was 80
      "min_test_coverage_branch": 85  // Was 75
    }
  }
}
```

### Adding New Agents

1. **Create JSON file:**
   ```bash
   cp .github/agents/agent_code_quality_enforcer.json \
      .github/agents/agent_my_new_agent.json
   ```

2. **Edit configuration** (follow existing schema)

3. **Register in coordinator:**
   ```json
   // .github/agents/agent_swarm_orchestration_coordinator.json
   {
     "agent_registry": {
       "my_new_agent": {
         "capabilities": ["my_capability"],
         "priority": "medium"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Commit and test**

### Disabling Agents Temporarily

**To skip an agent for one PR:**

Add to PR description:
```
[skip agent_name]
```

**To disable an agent completely:**

Rename the file:
```bash
mv agent_name.json agent_name.json.disabled
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Running

**Check:**
1. Is the trigger event correct?
   - View agent's `trigger_events` in JSON
2. Are workflows enabled?
   - GitHub → Settings → Actions → General
3. Check logs in Actions tab

### False Positives

**If an agent incorrectly flags code:**

1. Review the finding carefully
2. If truly false positive, add exception:
   ```typescript
   // eslint-disable-next-line rule-name
   const foo = bar;
   ```
3. Or adjust agent configuration

### Slow Agent Response

**Typical times:**
- Code quality: 2-5 minutes
- Tests: 10-15 minutes
- E2E tests: 15-25 minutes

**If slower:**
- Check GitHub Actions queue
- Review agent timeout settings
- Consider increasing `timeout_minutes`

### Agent Conflicts

**If agents give contradictory advice:**

1. Security wins over performance
2. Tests win over style
3. Check `swarm-orchestration-coordinator` logs
4. File an issue for review
