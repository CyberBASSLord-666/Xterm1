# ============================================================================
# Core CI Workflow for PolliWall (Xterm1)
# ============================================================================
# This is the main continuous integration pipeline that runs on every push
# and pull request to ensure code quality and correctness.
#
# Jobs:
# - lint: ESLint validation for TypeScript and HTML files
# - test: Jest unit tests with coverage reporting
# - build: Production and development builds (matrix strategy)
# - e2e: Playwright end-to-end tests
# - lighthouse: Performance auditing with Lighthouse CI
#
# This workflow is part of the Agentic Swarm system and coordinates with:
# - swarm-coordinator.yml for orchestration
# - auto-fix-all.yml for automatic fixes
# - security.yml for security scanning
