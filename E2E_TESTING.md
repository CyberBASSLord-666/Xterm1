# E2E Testing Guide

This document explains the comprehensive E2E testing setup for PolliWall, including the firewall workaround solution.

## Overview

The project supports **two E2E testing frameworks**:

1. **Playwright** (Primary, Production-Ready) ✅ RECOMMENDED
2. **Cypress** (Alternative, requires firewall configuration)

## Firewall Issue & Solution

### The Problem

Cypress installation requires downloading binaries from `download.cypress.io`, which may be blocked by firewall rules in restricted environments. This prevents the `npm install` step from completing successfully.

### The Solution

We've implemented **Playwright** as the primary E2E testing framework because:

✅ **No Firewall Issues** - Playwright can be pre-installed in GitHub Actions  
✅ **Better Browser Support** - Native Chromium, Firefox, WebKit  
✅ **Faster Execution** - Parallel test execution  
✅ **Better Mobile Testing** - Device emulation built-in  
✅ **Professional Reports** - HTML, JSON, and visual regression  

Cypress tests are maintained as an alternative for environments where installation is possible.

## Playwright Testing (Primary Framework)

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

Playwright is installed as part of the standard dependencies and doesn't require external downloads during install.

### Running Tests

**Interactive Mode** (UI)
```bash
npm run e2e
```

**Headless Mode** (CI)
```bash
npm run e2e:headless
```

**Specific Browser**
```bash
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project=firefox
npx playwright test --project=webkit
```

**With Debugging**
```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```

**Generate Test Report**
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

### Test Structure

```
playwright/
├── e2e/
│   ├── app.spec.ts          # Main application tests
│   └── wizard.spec.ts       # Wizard workflow tests
└── playwright.config.ts      # Configuration
```

### Features

- **Multi-Browser Testing**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
- **Mobile Testing**: iPhone, Pixel emulation
- **Parallel Execution**: Faster test runs
- **Visual Regression**: Screenshot comparison
- **Accessibility Testing**: WCAG compliance checks
- **Video Recording**: On test failure
- **Trace Viewer**: Step-by-step debugging

### Configuration

The `playwright.config.ts` provides:

```typescript
{
  testDir: './playwright/e2e',
  timeout: 30000,
  fullyParallel: true,
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
  reporter: [
    ['html', { outputFolder: 'playwright-report' }],
    ['json', { outputFile: 'playwright-report/results.json' }],
    ['list']
  ],
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:4200',
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
    video: 'retain-on-failure'
  },
  projects: [
    { name: 'chromium', use: devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
    { name: 'firefox', use: devices['Desktop Firefox'] },
    { name: 'webkit', use: devices['Desktop Safari'] },
    { name: 'Mobile Chrome', use: devices['Pixel 5'] },
    { name: 'Mobile Safari', use: devices['iPhone 12'] }
  ],
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm start',
    url: 'http://localhost:4200',
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
    timeout: 120000
  }
}
```

### Test Coverage

**app.spec.ts** covers:
- Application loading and initialization
- Navigation functionality (Gallery, Settings, Wizard)
- Theme toggling and persistence
- Console error detection
- Responsive design (mobile/desktop)
- Basic accessibility compliance
- Keyboard navigation

**wizard.spec.ts** covers:
- Wizard form display
- Prompt input and validation
- Style preset selection
- Advanced settings expansion
- Generation workflow
- Form field accessibility
- Model selection
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Long prompt handling
- Form state persistence

## Cypress Testing (Alternative Framework)

### Prerequisites

Cypress requires the firewall to allow `download.cypress.io` or must be installed in an environment with custom firewall rules.

### Installation (If Firewall Allows)

```bash
npm install cypress --save-dev
```

### Running Tests

**Interactive Mode**
```bash
npm run e2e:cypress
```

**Headless Mode**
```bash
npm run e2e:cypress:headless
```

### Test Structure

```
cypress/
├── e2e/
│   ├── app.cy.ts            # Main application tests
│   └── wizard.cy.ts         # Wizard workflow tests
├── support/
│   ├── commands.ts          # Custom commands
│   └── e2e.ts               # Configuration
└── cypress.config.ts         # Configuration
```

### Custom Commands

Cypress includes comprehensive custom commands:

```typescript
// Accessibility audit (8+ checks)
cy.checkA11y()

// Wait for app ready
cy.waitForAppReady()

// Check console errors
cy.checkConsoleErrors()

// Test keyboard navigation
cy.testKeyboardNav('button')

// Login (authentication simulation)
cy.login('username', 'password')
```

### Features

- **Comprehensive A11y Checks**: 8+ accessibility validations
- **Real Browser Testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge
- **Time Travel Debugging**: Step through test execution
- **Network Stubbing**: Mock API responses
- **Visual Testing**: Screenshot comparison

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Configuration

The CI workflow uses **Playwright** to avoid firewall issues:

```yaml
jobs:
  e2e:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      - run: npm run e2e:headless
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always()
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```

### Why This Works

1. **npm ci** installs Playwright without issues
2. **npx playwright install** downloads browsers (allowed by default)
3. Tests run in headless mode
4. Reports are uploaded as artifacts

### Firewall Allowlist (Optional)

If you want to use Cypress in CI/CD, add to repository settings:

```
Copilot Coding Agent Settings > Custom Allowlist:
- download.cypress.io
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Tests

✅ **DO:**
- Use descriptive test names
- Test user workflows, not implementation details
- Add accessibility checks to all tests
- Use proper waits (not arbitrary timeouts)
- Test responsive design
- Check for console errors

❌ **DON'T:**
- Test internal component state directly
- Use fixed delays (use waitForSelector instead)
- Skip accessibility tests
- Test only happy paths
- Ignore mobile viewports

### Test Maintenance

1. **Keep tests independent** - Each test should run in isolation
2. **Clean up after tests** - Reset state between tests
3. **Use page objects** - Abstract UI interactions
4. **Update selectors carefully** - Use data-testid attributes
5. **Run locally before pushing** - Catch issues early

### Debugging Failed Tests

**Playwright:**
```bash
# Run with UI for debugging
npm run e2e

# Run with trace
npx playwright test --trace on

# View trace
npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

**Cypress:**
```bash
# Open interactive mode
npm run e2e:cypress

# Video is automatically recorded on failure
```

## Performance Optimization

### Parallel Execution

Playwright runs tests in parallel by default:

```typescript
fullyParallel: true,
workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined, // Max parallel workers
```

### Selective Testing

Run specific tests:

```bash
# Playwright
npx playwright test app.spec.ts
npx playwright test wizard.spec.ts --project=chromium

# Cypress  
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/app.cy.ts"
```

### Test Sharding (CI)

For large test suites, shard across multiple machines:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    shard: [1, 2, 3, 4]
steps:
  - run: npx playwright test --shard=${{ matrix.shard }}/4
```

## Accessibility Testing

Both frameworks include comprehensive accessibility checks:

### Playwright
```typescript
test('should be accessible', async ({ page }) => {
  // Check images have alt text
  const images = await page.locator('img').all();
  for (const img of images) {
    await expect(img).toHaveAttribute('alt');
  }
  
  // Check buttons have accessible names
  const buttons = await page.locator('button').all();
  for (const btn of buttons) {
    const text = await btn.textContent();
    const ariaLabel = await btn.getAttribute('aria-label');
    expect(text?.trim() || ariaLabel).toBeTruthy();
  }
  
  // Check heading hierarchy
  const h1Count = await page.locator('h1').count();
  expect(h1Count).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});
```

### Cypress
```typescript
it('should be accessible', () => {
  cy.checkA11y(); // Runs 8+ checks
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Tests timeout**
- Solution: Increase timeout in config
- Check app is running on correct port
- Verify network connectivity

**Issue: Flaky tests**
- Solution: Add proper waits
- Use retry logic
- Check for race conditions

**Issue: Screenshots don't match**
- Solution: Update baseline images
- Check viewport size consistency
- Consider visual regression thresholds

**Issue: Playwright install fails**
- Solution: Run `npx playwright install --with-deps`
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify disk space

**Issue: Cypress blocked by firewall**
- Solution: Use Playwright instead
- Configure firewall allowlist
- Use pre-installed Cypress in CI

## Migration from Cypress to Playwright

If you're currently using Cypress and want to migrate:

1. **Install Playwright**
   ```bash
   npm install @playwright/test --save-dev
   ```

2. **Convert Tests**
   - `cy.visit()` → `page.goto()`
   - `cy.get()` → `page.locator()`
   - `cy.click()` → `locator.click()`
   - `cy.should()` → `expect().toBe()`

3. **Update CI/CD**
   - Replace Cypress commands with Playwright
   - Update artifact paths

4. **Remove Cypress** (optional)
   ```bash
   npm uninstall cypress
   ```
